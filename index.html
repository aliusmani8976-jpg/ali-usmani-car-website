            <h2>01 // 2026 WOVEN CITY LAUNCH</h2>
            <p>As of <span class="highlight">February 2026</span>, Toyota has officially opened the gates of <span class="highlight">Woven City</span> to general visitors. After the first "Weavers" (employees and families) moved in during late 2025, the city has become a living laboratory for 2,000 residents. Every home is powered by a localized hydrogen fuel cell grid, and the streets are divided into three distinct paths: one for fast vehicles, one for micromobility (e-scooters), and one for pedestrians. This is no longer a concept—it is a functioning 175-acre smart city at the base of Mt. Fuji.</p>

            <p>Enthusiasts around the world are currently tracking the <span class="highlight">2026 GR Supra MkV Final Edition</span>. Toyota has confirmed that 2026 will be the final production year for the current Supra generation. This special send-off model features a carbon-fiber ducktail spoiler, 19-inch matte black wheels, and a suspension re-tuned specifically for track-day grip. Only <span class="highlight">1,300 units</span> are being produced globally, marking the end of an era for the BMW-partnered sports icon.</p>

            <h2>03 // 2025 SALES RECORDS</h2>
            <p>In data released in <span class="highlight">January 2026</span>, Toyota maintained its crown as the world's top-selling automaker for the sixth year in a row. Despite global economic shifts and new tariffs, Toyota sold a record-breaking <span class="highlight">10.5 million vehicles</span> in 2025. Hybrid demand in the United States, specifically for the RAV4 and Prius, drove this massive growth. For 2026, Toyota has notified suppliers to prepare for production exceeding 10 million units once again.</p>

            <h2>04 // THE NEXT-GEN BATTERY ROADMAP</h2>
            <p>Toyota is currently in the "Phase 2" implementation of its battery roadmap. By the end of 2026, Toyota aims to reveal six new battery-electric (BEV) models. The big goal remains the <span class="highlight">Solid-State Battery</span>, which is scheduled for commercial use by 2027/28. These batteries are expected to provide over <span class="highlight">620 miles of range</span> and charge from 10% to 80% in less than 10 minutes.</p>
