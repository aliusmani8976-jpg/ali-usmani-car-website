<!-- Section 1: Future and Robots -->
<h2>Toyota's Robot and Space Future 🤖</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  Toyota isn't just making cars anymore! They are building a real-life 
  <strong>"Woven City"</strong> at the foot of Mt. Fuji in Japan where they 
  test self-driving shuttles called <strong>e-Palettes</strong>. These shuttles 
  can be mobile shops or even offices! They are even working on a 
  <strong>Lunar Cruiser</strong> to help astronauts drive on the Moon and 
  special flying taxis with a company called Joby Aviation.
</p>

<!-- Section 2: Helping the Earth -->
<h2>Helping the Earth 🌍</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  Toyota wants to save the planet. In 1997, they made the <strong>Prius</strong>, 
  the first-ever mass-produced hybrid car! Since then, their hybrid cars have 
  saved <strong>77 million tons of CO2</strong> from going into the air. 
  They also made the <strong>Mirai</strong>, a car that runs on hydrogen 
  and its only "exhaust" is <strong>pure water</strong>!
</p>

<!-- Section 3: Racing and Speed -->
<h2>Racing and Fast Cars 🏎️</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  Did you know Toyota has its own racing team called <strong>GAZOO Racing</strong>? 
  They make super fast sports cars like the <strong>GR Supra</strong> and 
  the <strong>GR86</strong>. They have won big races like the 24 Hours of 
  Le Mans many times. Their cars are so tough that even after 20 years, 
  <strong>80% of Toyotas</strong> are still driving on the road today!
</p>

<!-- Section 4: Just for Kids -->
<h2>Cool Kids' Stuff 🎨</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
  Every year, Toyota holds a <strong>Dream Car Art Contest</strong> where 
  kids like you draw cars of the future. Some kids draw cars that run on 
  sweets or cars that can turn into submarines! They even showed off a 
  concept car called <strong>Kids Mobi</strong>—a tiny self-driving pod 
  just for kids that has an AI friend to talk to.
